`Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/>`_ are growing in
popularity with data scientists and have become the de facto standard for
rapid prototyping and exploratory analysis. They inspire experiments and

and more reliable. In addition, many additional components are created that
expand the original limits of their use and enable new uses.
