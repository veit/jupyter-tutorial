pandas
======

`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a Python library for data analysis
that has become very popular in recent years. On the website, pandas is
described thus:

    „pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data
    analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming
    language.“

More specifically, pandas is an in-memory analysis tool that offers SQL-like
constructs, as well as statistical and analytical tools. In doing so, pandas
builds on Cython and NumPy, making it less memory intensive and faster than pure
Python code. Mostly pandas is used to

* replace :doc:`/data-processing/serialisation-formats/excel` and `Power BI
  <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_
* implement an `ETL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load>`_
  process
* process :doc:`/data-processing/serialisation-formats/csv/index` or
  :doc:`/data-processing/serialisation-formats/json/index` data
* prepare machine learning
