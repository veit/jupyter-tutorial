Executable Books
================

`Executable Books <https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/>`_ is a collection of
open-source tools that facilitate the publication of computational narratives
using the Jupyter ecosystem, primarily:

Jupyter Book
    :doc:`index` distribution that allows you to write content in Markdown and
    Jupyter Notebooks, execute content and insert it into your book.

    .. seealso::
       * `jupyterbook.org <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html>`_ is

       * `gallery.jupyterbook.org
         <https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery/>`_ is a gallery of
         Jupyter books.

         repository.

MyST
    is an extensible semantic variant of Markdown designed for scientific and
    computational narratives. MyST-Markdown is a language- and
    implementation-independent variant of Markdown supported by several tools.

    .. seealso::

         specification.
       * `MyST Enhancement Proposals
         <https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-enhancement-proposals>`_ is a
         process for proposing and deciding on changes to the MyST
         specification.

JupyterLab MyST Extension
    renders Markdown cells in :doc:`/jupyterlab/index` using MyST Markdown,
    including interactive references, notes, figure numbering, tabs, cards and
    grids.
