Sphinx
======

`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, a documentation tool that
converts :doc:`python-basics:document/rest` into HTML or PDF, EPub and man
pages. The Jupyter tutorial is also created with Sphinx.

Originally developed for Python documentation, Sphinx is now used in almost all
Python projects, including `NumPy <https://numpy.org/devdocs/>`_ and `SciPy
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_, `Matplotlib
<https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html>`_, `pandas
<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`_ and `SQLAlchemy
<https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/>`_.

With :doc:`nbsphinx`, Jupyter Notebooks can also be integrated into Sphinx.
:doc:`executablebooks`, on the other hand, is a collection of open-source tools
that allow you to write Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, execute content and
insert it into your book, among other things.
