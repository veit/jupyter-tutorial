languages can be used in notebooks. The following Jupyter kernels are widely
used:

* R

  * IRKernel: `Docs <https://irkernel.github.io/>`__ | `GitHub <https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel>`__
  * IRdisplay: `GitHub <https://github.com/IRkernel/IRdisplay>`__
  * Repr: `GitHub <https://github.com/IRkernel/repr>`__

* Julia

  * IJulia: `GitHub <https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl>`__
  * Interact.jl: `GitHub <https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Interact.jl>`__

A list of available kernels can be found in `Jupyter kernels
