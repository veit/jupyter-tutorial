Create a product
================

With Jupyter Notebooks you can quickly build prototypes for data analysis. You
can also use them to document and present your results. However, they are not
well suited for reproducing your results with :menuselection:`Kernel ‣ Restart
and Run All` in a few days or years. For example, the notebooks contain very
little information about the environment, the :doc:`kernel
</workspace/jupyter/kernels/index>`, with which they have been able to run
successfully in the past. Although you can use ``pd.show_versions()`` to display
:ref:`/workspace/ipython/examples.ipynb#Information-about-the-host-operating-system-and-the-versions-of-installed-Python-packages`,
this is unfortunately not sufficient to reproduce such an environment.

In order for others to be able to use your code, it should meet some conditions:

* You should not silently rely on specific resources and environments
* Required software packages and hardware should be specified in the
  requirements
* Path information will only work in a different context within your package or
  in previously generated directories and files
* Do not share secrets like login details or internal IP numbers in your
  published product

There are various tools that support you in creating shareable products. These
can be tools on the one hand for the :doc:`versioning of the source code
<git/index>` and the :doc:`training data <dvc/index>` as well as for the
reproducibility of the :doc:`execution environments <envs/index>`, on the other
hand for :doc:`testing`, :doc:`logging/index`, :doc:`documenting <documenting>`
and :doc:`creating packages <python-basics:libs/index>`.
