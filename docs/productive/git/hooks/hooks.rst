pre-commit scripts
==================

`pre-commit-hooks <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks>`_
    The pre-commit framework already comes with a whole range of scripts,
    including:

    ``check-added-large-files``

    ``check-case-conflict``
        looks for files that would conflict in case-insensitive file systems
    ``check-executables-have-shebangs``
        makes sure that (non-binary) executables have a shebang line
    ``check-shebang-scripts-are-executable``
        makes sure (non-binary) files are executable with a shebang line
    ``check-symlinks``
        checks for symlinks that donâ€™t point to anything
    ``destroyed-symlinks``
        detects symlinks that have been changed into regular files with the
        contents of the path the symlink points to.

`pygrep-hooks <https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks>`_
    provides regular expressions for Python and reStructuredText, including:

    ``python-no-log-warn``
        search for the deprecated ``.warn()`` method of Python loggers
    ``python-use-type-annotations``
        forces type-annotations to be used instead of type-comments
    ``rst-backticks``
        detects the use of single backticks when writing reStructuredText
    ``rst-directive-colons``
        detects that reStructuredText directives do not end with a colon or a
        space before the colon
    ``rst-inline-touching-normal``
        detects that inline code is used in normal text in reStructuredText
    ``text-unicode-replacement-char``
        prevents files that contain UTF-8 Unicode Replacement Characters
