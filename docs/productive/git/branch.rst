Git branches
============

:samp:`$ git branch [-a]`
    shows all local branches in a repository.

    ``-a``
        also shows all removed branches.

:samp:`$ git branch [{BRANCHNAME}]`
    creates a new branch based on the current ``HEAD``.

:samp:`$ git switch [-c] [{BRANCHNAME}]`
    switches between branches.

    ``-c``
        creates a new branch.

    .. note::

        In Git < 2.23, ``git switch`` is not yet available. In this case you
        still need to use ``git checkout``:

        :samp:`$ git checkout [-b] [{BRANCHNAME}]`
            changes the working directory to the specified branch.

            ``-b``
                creates the specified branch if it does not already exist.

:samp:`$ git merge [{FROMBRANCHNAME}]`
    connects the given branch with the current branch you are currently in, for
    example:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git checkout main
        $ git merge hotfix
        Updating f42c576..3a0874c
        Fast forward
         setup.py |    1 -
         1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

    ``Fast forward``
        means that the new commit immediately followed the original commit and
        so the branch pointer only had to be continued.

        In other cases the output can look like this:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ git checkout main
            $ git merge '#42'
            Merge made by recursive.
             setup.py |    1 +
             1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

    ``recursive``
        is a merge strategy that is used when the merge is only to be done to
        ``HEAD``.

.. _merge-conflicts:

Merge conflicts
---------------

Occasionally, however, Git runs into issues with merging, such as:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git merge '#17'
        Auto-merging setup.py
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in setup.py
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Branches
--------

:samp:`$ git branch -d [{BRANCHNAME}]`
    deletes the selected branch if it has already been transferred to another.

    ``-D`` instead of ``-d`` forcing the deletion.
