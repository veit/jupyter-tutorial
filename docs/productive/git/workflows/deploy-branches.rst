Deployment branches
===================

They are recommended if, for example, you cannot determine the release time
yourself, for example if an iOS application has to pass the app store validation
or you only have a fixed time window available for deployment. In this case, a
production branch ``prod``, that reflects the code provided is recommended. Such
a workflow prevents the additional work of ``git flow`` for releasing and
tagging.


Assuming that you have a ``development``, ``staging`` and ``production``
environment, then a merge or pull request for a feature is first made to the
``staging`` branch. As long as the quality check has been passed there, the
changes and the code can be ready for production, the changes can be transferred
to the ``main`` branch. This process can be repeated several times for new
features until for example the time has come for the *going life* of these
changes and a deployment branch can be created.

.. _release-branches:

Release branches
================

Release branches are recommended when software is to be delivered to customers.
In this case each branch should contain a minor version, for example ``2.7`` or
``3.4``. Usually these branches are created from the ``main`` branch as late
as possible. This reduces the number of merges that have to be distributed
across multiple branches during bug fixes. Usually, these are first transferred
to the  ``main`` and then transferred from there to the release branch with
:doc:`../cherry-pick`, for example:

.. code-block:: console

     $ git switch 3.10
     $ git cherry-pick 61de025
     [3.10 b600967] Fix bug #17
      Date: Thu Sep 15 11:17:35 2022 +0200
      1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)

This upstream first approach is for example used by `Google
<https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/upstream-first>`_
and `Red Hat
<https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/a-community-for-using-openstack-with-red-hat-rdo>`_.
Every time a bug fix has been adopted in a release branch, the release is
increased by a patch version with a `Tag
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_, see also `Semantic
Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
