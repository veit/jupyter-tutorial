GitLab
======

`GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`_ is a web application for version management based
on Git. Later, further functions were added such as an issue tracking system with
Kanban board, a system for `Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
(CI/CD) <https://about.gitlab.com/features/continuous-integration/>`_ as well as
a Wiki and Snippets. The GitLab Community Edition (CE) is developed as open
source software under the MIT licence and can be installed on-premises.

The GitLab CI tools enable automated builds and deployments without the need for
external integrations. If a PaaS solution such as `Kubernetes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes>`_ is already in use, apps can be
automatically deployed, tested and scaled with GitLab CI/CD. In addition, code
can be automatically scanned for potential security risks.

GitLab is a completely packaged platform, while GitHub can be extended with apps
from the Marketplace. However, this does not mean that GitLab cannot be
integrated, for example with Asana, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.
