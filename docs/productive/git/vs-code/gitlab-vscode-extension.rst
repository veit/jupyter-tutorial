GitLab VS Code Extension
========================

`GitLab VS Code Extension
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension>`_ integrates GitLab â‰¥
13.0 into Visual Studio Code:

Display GitLab issues and merge requests
    Issues, comments, merge requests and changed files are displayed in the
    sidebar or in a `custom search
    <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/docs/user/custom-queries.md#custom-queries>`_.
Create and review merge requests
    Issues can be commented directly in VS Code, and `GitLab Slash Commands
    <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/slash_commands.html>`_ are also
    supported. You can create, edit and delete comments in the diff view of a
    merge request.
Configuring and validating GitLab CI/CD
    You can edit the :file:`gitlab-ci.yml` file, which automatically completes
    the variables. You can also validate the file locally.
Search the repository without cloning
    You can access repositories read-only, provided that an access token is
    registered for the corresponding GitLab instance.
