Licensing
=========

In order for others to use your software, it should have one or more licences
that describe the terms of use. Otherwise, it is likely to be protected by
copyright. Authors are those who have originally contributed to the software. If
software is to be licensed, the consent of all those who can claim authorship is
required.

.. note::
   This does not constitute legal advice. If in doubt, contact a lawyer or the
   legal department of your company.

Proprietary software licenses
-----------------------------

Proprietary software licenses are rarely standardised; they can be commercial,
shareware, or freeware.

Free and open source software licenses
--------------------------------------

They are defined by the `Free Software Foundation (FSF)
<https://www.fsf.org/de/?set_language=de>`_ and the `Open Source Initiative
(OSI) <https://opensource.org/>`_. A distinction can essentially be made between
copyleft, permissive and public domain licenses.

Copyleft licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copyleft licenses oblige the licensees to place any processing of the software
under the license of the original work. This is to prevent usage restrictions of
the software. The best known copyleft license is the GNU General Public License
(GPL). The copyleft of the GPL is seen as very strong, while that of the Mozilla
Public License is seen as very weak.

Since the licensors are not bound by their own copyleft, they can also publish
new versions under a proprietary license or allow third parties to do so
(multiple licensing).

Copyleft licenses can quickly lead to incompatibilities with free licenses
without copyleft. For example, the 3 Clause BSD license is incompatible with the
GPL.

Permissive open source licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissive open source licenses allow broader reuse than copyleft licenses.
Derivatives and copies of the source code can be distributed under conditions
that have fundamentally different properties than those of the original license.
The best known examples of such licenses are the MIT license and the BSD
license.

Public domain licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of public domain licenses, copyrights are transferred to the general
public. The Creative Commons Zero license was created to identify the release of
the greatest possible usage rights.

Non-software licences
---------------------

Open source software licences can also be used for works that are not software.
They are often also the best choice, especially if the works in question are
edited and versioned as source code.

Data, media, :abbr:`etc. (et cetera)`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`CC0-1.0 <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de>`_,
`CC-BY-4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de>`_ and
`CC-BY-SA-4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de>`_ are
open licences used for non-software material, from datasets to videos. However,
they are `not recommended for software
<https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software>`_.

The `Open Knowledge Foundation <https://okfn.org>`_ has also published a set of
`Open Data Commons <https://opendatacommons.org>`_ licences for data/databases:

`Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0 <https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/>`_
    Attribution and sharing under equal terms.
`Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By) v1.0 <https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/>`_
    Attribution.
`Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) v1.0 <https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/>`_
    The PDDL places the data in the public domain and waives all rights.

`GovData <https://www.govdata.de>`_ has submitted the *Data Licence Germany* in two variants:

* `Datenlizenz Deutschland – Namensnennung – Version 2.0
  <https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0>`_
* `Datenlizenz Deutschland – Zero – Version 2.0
  <https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/zero-2-0>`_

When using the `Community Data License Agreement – Permissive, Version 2.0 <https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/>`_ the copyright notices must be retained.

Another possible licence for artistic works is the `Free Art License 1.3
<https://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any open source software licence or open media licence also applies to software
documentation. If you use different licences for your software and its
documentation, you should make sure that the source code examples in the
documentation are also licensed under the software licence. In addition to the
Creative Commons licences mentioned above, the following licences are available
specifically for free documentation.

`GNU Free Documentation License (FDL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.txt>`_
    Copyleft licence for documentation to be used for all GNU manuals. Its
    applicability is limited to textual works (books).
`FreeBSD Documentation License <https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license/>`_
    Permissive documentation licence with copyleft, compatible with the GNU FDL.
`Open Publication License, Version 1.0 <https://opencontent.org/openpub/>`_
    Free documentation licence with copyleft, provided none of the licence
    options in Section VI of the licence are used. In any case, it is
    incompatible with the GNU FDL.

Fonts
~~~~~

`SIL Open Font License 1.1 <https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1>`_
    Font licence that can be freely used in other works.
`GNU General Public License 3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0>`_
    It can also be used for fonts, but it may only be included in documents with
    the `font exception
    <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException>`_.

    .. seealso::
       * `Font Licensing <https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050425novalis>`_

`LaTeX ec fonts <https://dante.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ec/src/copyrite.txt>`_
    Free *European Computer Modern and Text Companion* fonts commonly used with
    Latex.
`Arphic Public License <https://spdx.org/licenses/Arphic-1999>`_
    Free licence with copyleft.
`IPA Font license <https://spdx.org/licenses/IPA.html>`_
    Free licence with copyleft, but derived values may not use or contain the
    name of the original.

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

Designs for `open source hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`_ are
covered by the CERN Open Hardware licences:

`CERN-OHL-P-2.0 <https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_p_v2.txt>`_
    permissive
`CERN-OHL-W-2.0 <https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_w_v2.txt>`_
    weakly reciprocal
`CERN-OHL-S-2.0 <https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt>`_
    strongly reciprocal

Choosing a suitable license
---------------------------

Overviews of possible licenses can be found in the `SPDX License List
<https://spdx.org/licenses/>`_ or `OSI Open Source Licenses by Category
<https://opensource.org/licenses/category>`_. When choosing suitable licences,
the websites `Choose an open source license <https://choosealicense.com/>`_ and
`Comparison of free and open-source software licenses
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses>`_
will help you.

If you want to achieve the widest possible distribution of your package, for
example, MIT or BSD versions are a good choice. The Apache licence protects you
better from from patent infringement, but it is not compatible with the GPL v2.

Check dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Therefore, you should look at the licences of the packages you depend on and
should be compatible with. To analyse licences, you can look at `license
compatibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility>`_ and use
`licensechecker
<https://boyter.org/2018/03/licensechecker-command-line-application-identifies-software-license/>`_, a command line tool that scans installation directories for
licences.

It can also be useful to release a package under multiple licences. An example of this is cryptography/LICENSE.

Furthermore, it can also be useful to publish a package under several licences.
An example of this is `cryptography/LICENSE
<https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/adf234e/LICENSE>`_.

GitHub
------

On `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ you can have an open source license created
in your repository.

#. Go to the main page of your repository.
#. Click on *Create new file* and then enter ``LICENSE`` or ``LICENSE.md`` as
   the file name.
#. Then you can click on *Choose a license template*.
#. Now you can select the open source license that is suitable for your
   repository.
#. You will now be asked for additional information if the selected license
   requires this.
#. After you have given a commit message, for example ``Add license``, you can
   click on *Commit new file*.

If you’ve already added a ``/LICENSE`` file to your repository, GitHub uses
`licensee <https://github.com/licensee/licensee>`_ to compare the file with a
short `list of open source licenses  <https://choosealicense.com/appendix/>`_.
If GitHub can’t detect your repository’s license, it might contain multiple
licenses or be too complex. Then consider whether you can simplify the license,
for example by outsourcing complexity to the ``/README`` file.

Conversely, you can also search for repositories with specific licenses or
license families on GitHub. You can get an overview of the license keywords in
`Searching GitHub by license type
<https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#searching-github-by-license-type>`_.

Finally, you can have `Shields.io <https://shields.io/>`_ generate a license
badge for you, which you can include in your ``README`` file, for example

.. code-block:: rst

    |License|

    .. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/veit/jupyter-tutorial.svg
       :target: https://github.com/veit/jupyter-tutorial/blob/main/LICENSE

|License|

.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/veit/jupyter-tutorial.svg
   :target: https://github.com/veit/jupyter-tutorial/blob/main/LICENSE

Standard format for licensing
-----------------------------

`SPDX <https://spdx.dev/>`_ stands for *Software Package Data Exchange* and
defines a standardised method for the exchange of copyright and licensing
information between projects and people. You can choose the appropriate SPDX
identifiers from the `SPDX License List <https://spdx.org/licenses/>`_ and then
add to the header of your licence files:

.. code-block::

    # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: [year] [copyright holder] <[email address]>
    #
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: [identifier]

Check conformity
----------------

`REUSE <https://reuse.software/>`_ was initiated by the Free Software Foundation
Europe (FSFE) to facilitate the licensing of free software projects. The `REUSE
tool <https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/tool>`_ checks licenses and supports you in
compliance with the license. With the `REUSE API
<https://reuse.software/dev/#api>`_ you can also generate a dynamic compliance
badge:

.. figure:: reuse-compliant.svg
   :alt: REUSE-compliant Badge

.. _gitlab-ci-workflow:

CI workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily integrate REUSE into your continuous integration workflow, for
example for GitLab in the ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file with:

.. code-block:: yaml

    reuse:
      image:
        name: fsfe/reuse:latest
        entrypoint: [""]
      script:
        - reuse lint

Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`ClearlyDefined <https://clearlydefined.io/>`_
    It collects and displays information about the licensing and copyright
    situation of a software project.
:ref:`open_chain`
    It recommends REUSE as a component to improve the clarity of the licensing
    and copyright situation, but has more stringent requirements to achieve full
    compliance.
`FOSSology <https://www.fossology.org/>`_
    Free software compliance toolkit that stores information in a database with
    license, copyright, and export scanners.

.. _open_chain:

ISO/IEC 5230/OpenChain
----------------------

`ISO/IEC 5230 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_5230>`_ is based on the
`OpenChain Specification 2.1
<https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/License-Compliance-Specification/raw/master/2.1/en/openchainspec-2.1.pdf>`_
and is an international standard on software supply chains, simplified
procurement and open source licence compliance.

     <https://certification.openchainproject.org>`_
   * `Reference-Material

Python package metadata
-----------------------

In Python packages there are other fields where licence information is stored,
such as the `core metadata specifications
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/>`_, which
are also limited. This leads not only to problems for authors to specify the
correct licence, but also to problems when re-packaging for various Linux
distributions.

Currently, although some common cases are covered and the licence classification
can also be extended, there are some popular classifications such as
:samp:`License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License` that will be abolished. However,
this means that backwards compatibility is no longer guaranteed and the packages
have to be relicensed. At least you have a way to check your trove
classifications with `trove-classifiers
<https://github.com/pypa/trove-classifiers>`_.
