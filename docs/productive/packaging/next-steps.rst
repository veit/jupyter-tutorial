Next steps
==========

Pleas keep in mind that your package on  *Test-PyPI* is only stored temporarily.
If you want to upload a package to the real :term:`Python Package Index (PyPI)`,
you can do so by creating an account on https://pypi.org and following the same
instructions, but using ``twine upload dist/*``.

And if you want to learn more about Python libraries, you can

* read more about how `setuptools
  <https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#setuptools>`_ can be used to pack
  and distribute packages: `Packaging and distributing projects
  <https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/>`_.
* look at alternatives to `setuptools
  <https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#setuptools>`_ like
  `flit <https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#flit>`_,
  `hatch <https://github.com/ofek/hatch>`_ and
  `poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_.
