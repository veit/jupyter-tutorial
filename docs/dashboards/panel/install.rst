Installation
============

You can install Panel in the virtual environment of your Jupyter kernel with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv add panel

For some of the following examples additional packages are required such as
`Holoviews <https://holoviews.org/>`_ and `hvPlot
<https://hvplot.holoviz.org/>`_. They can be installed with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv add "holoviews[recommended hvplot
