Dashboards
==========

:doc:`voila/index`
    was developed by `QuantStack <https://quantstack.net/>`_ as a dashboard
    solution based on Jupyter Notebooks and :doc:`/ipywidgets/index`. It
    displays the output of all notebook cells.
:doc:`panel/index`
    was developed on the basis of `Bokeh <https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/>`_
    and `Param <https://github.com/holoviz/param>`_ and offers a Python toolkit
    specifically for creating apps and dashboards, but it does not only support
    Bokeh plots. It allows multi-level and multi-page workflows.

With this tabular overview you can quickly compare the activities and licenses
of the various libraries.
